# Privacy Policy  
  
**Last updated: May 2025**  
  
**Ngày Nghỉ is an app that respects your privacy:** *it does not collect, store, or share any personal user information.*  
  
## Data Collection  
  
The app does not request unnecessary permissions or access sensitive data.  
All the information displayed (national, tourism-related, and religious holidays) is public and stored locally on the user's device.  
  
The additional features in Ngày Nghỉ Pro, such as holiday statistics and comparisons, are generated and processed locally on your device. No information is sent to or stored on external servers.  
  
## In-App Purchases and Free Trial  
  
The app offers subscriptions via the App Store. All payment processing, free trials, and subscription management are handled exclusively by Apple. **Ngày Nghỉ does not access any personal, financial, or billing information at any time.**  
  
If a trial period is available, you may use Ngày Nghỉ Pro at no cost during that time. You will be charged automatically at the end of the trial period, **unless you cancel the subscription at least 24 hours in advance** through your App Store account.  
  
## Optional Permissions  
  
**Notifications:**  
Used only if you enable holiday reminders. These are local notifications generated on your device, with no communication to external servers. You can disable them anytime in your device settings.  
  
**Calendar:**  
If you choose to add a holiday to your calendar, a single event is saved with your confirmation. The app **cannot view, read, or modify other existing events.**  
  
## Third Parties  
  
Ngày Nghỉ does not use any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or data storage.  
  
## Email Contact  
  
If you choose to contact me via email, you will be sharing your email address and the name configured on your account (which may include your last name or other identifying information).  
  
This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry. **It is never shared with third parties or sold under any circumstances.**  
  
## Contact  
  
If you have questions about this policy, feel free to reach out through the [Discussions](https://github.com/lucasditomase/feriados/discussions) section.  
  
**Ngày Nghỉ is a personal project. All inquiries are read and appreciated.**
